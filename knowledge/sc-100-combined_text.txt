Unit: Introduction to best practices
Best practices vs antipatterns
Best practices are recommended ways to do things that have been found to be most effective or efficient. Best practices help you avoid mistakes and ensure that your resources and effort aren’t wasted.
Exact instructions on what to do, why to do it, who should do it, and how to do it.
High level principles to help with different types of decisions and actions.
Guidelines that are part of a reference architecture that describes components that should be included in a solution and how to integrate them.
An antipattern is a common mistake that leads to negative outcomes. It is the opposite of a best practice. Many best practices are designed to help you avoid antipatterns.

Key takeaways
To harden your infrastructure against ransomware attacks, follow these
 best practices:
Identify the business-critical systems that are most important to you and begin performing regular backups on those systems.
Check for multiple copies of backups stored in isolated, offline (air-gapped) locations.
Store backups in offline or off-site storage and/or immutable storage and require out-of-band steps before permitting an online backup to be modified or erased.
Backup
Validate that your backup is good before 
restoring it.
Exercise your business continuity/disaster recovery (BC/DR) plan regularly.
Protect or print supporting documents and systems required for recovery, such as restoration procedure documents and SolarWinds instances.
Restore
Develop a strategy to protect privileged roles.
Prevent attackers from obtaining a large scope of access for potential damage to data and systems. (All other security controls can easily be invalidated by an attacker with privileged access in your environment.)
Ensure responsive detection and remediation of common attacks on endpoints, email, and identities.

Sentinel workspace best practices
1
Tenancy
Fewer tenants, simpler to manage
If multiple tenants, one Sentinel workspace for each
Use Lighthouse to manage Sentinel instances in different tenants
2
Compliance
Data mostly stored in same region, except when using features like ML-based detection
3
Region
Use separate instances for each region―helps to avoid bandwidth and egress costs for moving data
between regions
4
Access
Combine resource-context RBAC and table-level RBAC (next slide)
Resource-content RBAC example
Sentinel workspace best practices (cont.)
Creation
Use the same workspace for both Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Cloud
Use a dedicated workspace cluster if your projected data ingestion is around or more than 1 TB per day
Management for multiple workspaces
Simplify your incident management and investigation by condensing and listing all incidents from each Microsoft Sentinel instance in a single location
Key takeaways―planning Sentinel Workspace

Threat intelligence
The most common forms of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) are threat indicators, also known as indicators of compromise (IoC) or indicators of attack (IoA)
This is data that associates observed artifacts such as URLs, file hashes, or IP addresses with known threat activity such as phishing, botnets, or malware
This form of threat intelligence is often called tactical threat intelligence
Threat intelligence in Sentinel
Integrate threat intelligence (TI) into Microsoft Sentinel through the following activities:
Import threat intelligence 
into Microsoft Sentinel by enabling 
data connectors
 to various TI platforms and feeds
View and manage
 the imported threat intelligence in 
Logs
 and in the 
Threat Intelligence
 blade of Microsoft Sentinel
Detect threats
 and generate security alerts and incidents using the built-in 
Analytics
 rule templates based on your imported threat intelligence
Visualize key information
 about your imported threat intelligence in Microsoft Sentinel with the 
Threat Intelligence workbook
Threat hunting―Sentinel
Key takeaways―security workflows
Use the following best practices guidance for incident response and automation capabilities to evaluate security workflows:
Incident response
Goals for the technical aspects:
Identify the scope of the attack operation
Identify the objective of the attack, if possible 
Goals for security operations (SecOps) aspects:
Ensure 
you

Unit
: Evaluate 
security posture of existing application portfolios
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is a cloud access security broker (CASB) which provides visibility, control over data travel, and analytics
to identify and combat cyberthreats.
CASB helps you better understand the overall cloud posture across SaaS apps and cloud services.
CASBs protect your environment by providing visibility, data security, threat protection, and compliance. 
The Security posture page in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps displays the scores for different environments and the evaluated posture of the status of all resources.
Unit: Evaluate application threats with 
threat modeling
Threat modeling: Overview and prioritization
To secure large application portfolios, enterprise applications must prioritize where to invest time and effort for tasks such as threat modeling.
To do this, you must identify applications with a high potential impact and/or a high potential exposure 
to threats.
Risk
Mitigation
High potential impact
Identify applications that would have a significant impact on the business if compromised
High exposure to attacks
Applications that are easily accessible to attackers. Examples include web applications on the open internet
Threat modeling 
helps secure your systems, applications, networks, and services. It can help you: 
Create a data-flow diagram by understanding the importance of capturing requirements and assumptions.
Find security issues in a system through learning about the framework.
Reduce or eliminate potential threats by learning about the security control categories. 
Highlight the importance of verifying assumptions, requirements, and fixes before deployment.
Application threat analysis
Gather information about the basic security controls
Connections authenticated?
Applying least privilege?
Is app activity logged and

Unit: Design a solution for secure access to applications
Azure Web Application Firewall
Centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits
and vulnerabilities.
Deployed with:
Azure Application Gateway 
Azure Front Door
Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) service from Microsoft (preview)
WAF on Azure App Gateway
Based on the Core Rule Set (CRS) from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
Create multiple policies, and they can be associated with an Application Gateway, to individual listeners, or to path-based routing rules on an Application Gateway
Application Gateway operates as an application delivery controller (ADC)
Offers Transport Layer Security (TLS), termination, cookie-based session affinity, round-robin load distribution, content-based routing, ability to host multiple websites, and security enhancements
WAF on Azure Front Door service
WAF on Front Door is a global and centralized solution
Associate WAF policy to one or more Front Door
front ends
Policy has two types of rules:
Custom rules that are authored by the customer
Managed rule sets that are a collection of Azure-managed preconfigured set of rules
The Azure-managed Default Rule Set includes rules against :
Cross-site scripting
Java attacks
Local file inclusion
PHP injection attacks
Remote command execution
Remote file inclusion
Session fixation
SQL injection protection

Unit: Securing containerized applications
Application 
l
ife cycle management in Azure Container Apps
The Azure Container Apps application life cycle revolves around revisions
When you deploy a container app, the first revision is automatically created
More revisions are created as containers change, or any adjustments are made to the “template” section of the configuration
A container app flows through four phases:
Deployment
Update
Deactivation
Shutdown
Deployment
Update
Deactivate
Key takeaways―security requirements for containers
Consider the following security requirements for containers:
Store and retrieve images from a private registry, such as Azure Container Registry.
Use solutions such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud to scan container images in a private registry and identify potential vulnerabilities. 
Secure credentials for logins or API access.
Allow only approved container images and control the flow of container images.
For Security posture management, use Microsoft Defender for Containers. You can view recommendations and remediate issues with this
.
Key takeaways―requirements for container orchestration
When you enable Microsoft Defender for Containers, Azure Kubernetes Service clusters and Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes clusters (Preview) protection are also enabled
Once Microsoft Defender for Containers is enabled, you can configure your Kubernetes data plane hardening
When Defender for Cloud protects a cluster hosted in Azure Kubernetes Service, the collection of audit log data is agentless and frictionless

Key takeaways―discovery and classification with Purview
Data discovery
With MS Purview, admin users can scan Azure and non-Azure data sources (including on-premises sources) to gather information about the data assets automatically.
It provides 
self-service options for various skill groups
 to decrease time to discover data.
It encourages admin users to consider scenarios (such as discover business-critical assets) across different dimensions (such as persona, source system, impact area, outcome).
Users can 
take advantage of Microsoft Purview’s map of the data estate to find data assets, see lineage, and so on.
Data classification
MS Purview works on the goal that the platform should 
automatically classify data based on a sampling of the data and allow manual override using custom classifications.
The classification integration endpoint in MS Purview enables taking physical samples and running them through the classification system to open objects like notebooks, pipelines, and so on. 
It helps protect sensitive data by identifying and labeling it and defining custom sensitive data types using Microsoft recommended practices. 
You can apply system or custom classifications on file, table, or column assets with over 90 system classifiers that Microsoft Purview provides.

2
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint baseline
3
Microsoft Edge baseline
4
Windows 365 Security baseline
Deploying baselines through Intune 
admin center
Selecting the appropriate baseline
To specify an appropriate security baseline, you should have a clear understanding of the target operating system.
The 
Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT) 
allows you to manage Microsoft-recommended security configuration baselines for Microsoft products.
For servers, use Azure security baselines to machines through 
Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark
.
If the focus of your security baseline is to configure endpoints (Windows Client), you can use 
Intune
 to automate the deployment and configuration. Note that Intune security baselines are not Computer Information Systems (CIS) or National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) compliant.
Separate baseline types can include the same settings but use different default values for those settings. Understand the defaults in the baselines and then modify each baseline for your requirements.
