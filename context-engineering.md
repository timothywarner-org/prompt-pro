## üéØ Tim's Pro Tips

### **For End Users:**
- **Start simple** - Complex prompts often fail more than simple ones
- **Test iteratively** - Small changes can have big impacts
- **Use examples** - Few-shot prompting is incredibly powerful
- **Be specific** - Vague prompts get vague results

### **For Developers:**
- **Design for failure** - LLMs are probabilistic, not deterministic
- **Implement retry logic** - Network issues and rate limits happen
- **Use structured outputs** - Function calling is your friend
- **Monitor everything** - Observability is crucial for production systems
